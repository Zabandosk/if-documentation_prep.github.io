# General View of the Admin Interface

Collective Access mainly has 2 softwares named Providence and Pawtucket2. The first one is for cataloguing the data, the second one is for publishing and displaying what has been catalogued. 

On this page we will briefly explain the general aspects of Providence, which we call "admin interface" by navigation through the main pages. 

```{note}
If you want to see the general aspects of the Pawtucket2, which we call "user interface", visit the [User Guide](../../user/user_intro.md) chapter. 
```

## Navigation

Admin interface has a navigation bar with the titles of the main sections. You can access every part of the website by using the navigation bar ({numref}`Figure {number} <navbar>`).

### Home

On the Home page you can see your widgets ({numref}`Figure {number} <home1>`). There is counts widget by default which displays the number of the data by their type. In fig 2 you can see there are 137 objects, 83 entities, 272 places and 70 collections in our database.

You can add other widgets by pressing the "Edit dashboard" button on the top right corner. This button will create a text to explain how to add widget. On the new screen, you need to press Add widget button on the right top to see all the widgets ({numref}`Figure {number} <home2>`).

Widgets
```
On this screes you can select any widget that you want by pressing the "plus button". And on the next screen you can drag the widget to any place on your screen. When you are completed editing your dashboard you can click "Done" on the top right of the screen and save it.


### New

On the navigation bar, if you move your cursor on "new" text, you can access the dropdown menu under that section ({numref}`Figure {number} <new1>`). Those menu items are data types of our repository. Some of the items has sub items under them. If you move your curser over those you can see the menu is expanding ({numref}`Figure {number} <new2>`). If you click on any of the item, you directly go to creating "new" data page. Creating a new data is explained on [Creating Data](../admininterface/02_creatingdata.md) page with details.
