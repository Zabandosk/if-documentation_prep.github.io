# Imagining Futures Repository Documentation

Imagining Futures is a project that.... (IF Overview?)

Who decides what gets to be remembered into the future, and to shape it?
We draw on the widest meaning of archive by including documents, material remains and creations, landscapes, oral transmissions, song, bodily movements, daily customs and ancestral laws. Join us in our aim is to build methodologies of egalitarian archiving practices that allow for co-existence and recognition of multiple experiences and narratives of the past that challenge a singular ‘we’.

Our aspiration, in recognising the power of archives, is to make them sites of engagement through:

exploratory labs
commissioned projects
creation of new archives
preservation of archives under threat
reading existing archives against the grain
and (re)thinking sites of memory.

And IF Repository is build to serve as a preservation and display space for those projects outcome. 

In this space, we will document all the relevant processes associated with accessing, maintaining, and developing the Imagining Futures Repository.
