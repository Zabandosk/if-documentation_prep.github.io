# General View of the Admin Interface

Collective Access mainly has 2 softwares named Providence and Pawtucket2. The first one is for cataloguing the data, the second one is for publishing and displaying what has been catalogued. 

On this page we will briefly explain the general aspects of Providence, which we call "admin interface" by navigation through the main pages. 

```{note}
If you want to see the general aspects of the Pawtucket2, which we call "user interface", visit the [User Guide](../../user/user_intro.md) chapter.
