# Collective Access Codebase Strategy

In pursuit of the long-term sustainability of the codebase for this project, we've devised a strategic approach. Firstly, we've chosen to fork the Collective Access codebase, enabling us to implement and track our modifications while maintaining synchronization with the main Collective Access codebase.

Forked repositories:

- Providence: <https://github.com/ImaginingFutures/providence>
- Pawtucket2: <https://github.com/ImaginingFutures/pawtucket2>

Secondly, we've opted to utilize a release candidate version of Collective Access ([2.0](https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence/tree/dev/php8)) instead of the latest stable version (1.7.17 - January 25, 2023), which lacks PHP 8 support. This choice is aimed at enhancing our ability to manage future updates to the Collective Access codebase. Additionally, the utilization of PHP 8 brings about noteworthy advancements in terms of speed, security, and efficiency.

Another crucial decision pertains to the selection of  [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/releases/8.2/en.php) for the project. This choice is aimed at enhancing our ability to manage future updates to the Collective Access codebase. Additionally, the utilization of PHP 8 brings about noteworthy advancements in terms of speed, security, and efficiency. Consequently, we've opted to employ a release candidate version of Collective Access instead of the latest stable version (1.7.16 - June 25, 2022), which lacks PHP 8 support.
